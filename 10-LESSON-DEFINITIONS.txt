JIRA / ATLASSIAN ADMINISTRATOR, CONSULTANT & PROGRAMMER — COURSE PLAN (Jira Cloud)
==========================================================================================

NOTE
----
This plan is designed specifically for ADMIN CONSOLE work (Atlassian Administration + Jira settings + Project settings),
not end‑user Jira usage. The Admin track is the primary track and is structured for an interactive “Admin Panel Simulator”.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRACK 1 (PRIMARY): JIRA / ATLASSIAN ADMIN (CLOUD) — SIMULATOR-READY LESSONS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Simulator “Rooms” (one-screen lessons)
--------------------------------------
1) Atlassian Administration (admin.atlassian.com)
   - Directory: Users, Groups
   - Admin roles / product access
   - Security / audit log (org level)

2) Jira settings (Jira Cloud)
   - Work items
   - System
   - Products (where applicable)
   - Apps (where applicable)

3) Project settings (Company-managed Jira + Jira Service Management)
   - Permissions, Workflows, Request types, Portal, SLAs, Queues, Automation, Knowledge base

4) Confluence admin (for knowledge base enablement)
   - Global permissions, Space permissions entry points

5) Assets (JSM / “Assets” formerly Insight)
   - Object schemas, object types, attributes, imports, roles/permissions, automation, AQL search

Design rule for lessons
-----------------------
- Each lesson is standalone and should not require navigating more than one “room” (one simulator screen).
- Bigger tasks are split into multiple lessons.
